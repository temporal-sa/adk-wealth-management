"""Fixed activity_tool wrapper for ADK + Temporal integration.

Two fixes over the upstream temporalio.contrib.google_adk_agents.workflow.activity_tool:

1. Multi-arg handling: upstream unpacks as positional args (*activity_args), but
   workflow.execute_activity only accepts a single positional arg. This version
   uses args=[...] for correct multi-arg handling.

2. Graceful failure: when an activity exhausts its retry policy, the error is
   caught and returned as a string to the LLM instead of crashing the ADK
   pipeline. This lets agents reason about tool failures. Temporal still shows
   the retry attempts in the UI.
